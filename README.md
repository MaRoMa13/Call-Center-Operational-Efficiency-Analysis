# Call-Center-Operational-Efficiency-Analysis
Data analysis project focused on evaluating call center operational efficiency through KPI analysis, statistical testing, and interactive dashboards.

## Industry
Telecommunications

## Business Problem
The company experienced high operational inefficiencies, including missed incoming calls, long waiting times, and low outbound call volume. Supervisors lacked clear metrics to identify underperforming operators and optimize team performance.

## Objective
Identify inefficient call center operators by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide data-driven recommendations to support operational decision-making.

## Data Description
The dataset includes virtual telephony service usage data and client information, covering:
- Incoming and outgoing calls
- Call duration and waiting time
- Operator identifiers
- Internal and external calls

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL
- Tableau
- Statistical Analysis

## Methodology
- Cleaned and transformed raw data (format correction, duplicates removal, null value validation).
- Created new metrics such as waiting time.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify performance patterns.
- Conducted hypothesis testing using ANOVA, Kruskal–Wallis, and Pearson correlation.
- Built interactive dashboards and visualizations in Tableau.

## Key Findings
- Identified operators with consistently higher waiting times and lower call handling efficiency.
- Detected statistically significant differences in performance across operators.
- Found correlations between call volume, waiting time, and call outcomes.

## Business Impact
The analysis provides supervisors with actionable metrics to:
- Monitor operator performance
- Prioritize training or corrective actions
- Improve service quality and reduce call abandonment

## Challenges & Learnings
- Managed data inconsistencies across multiple sources.
- Selected appropriate statistical tests based on data distribution.
- Strengthened problem-solving skills by iterating analysis approaches when assumptions were not met.
